# React Introduction & Philosophy

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. Created by Facebook in 2013, React has become one of the most popular frontend libraries due to its component-based architecture and efficient rendering system.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Component-Based Architecture
React applications are built using components - reusable pieces of UI that manage their own state and compose together to form complex interfaces.

```jsx
// Simple component example
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

### 2. Virtual DOM
React uses a Virtual DOM - a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. This allows React to:
- Calculate the minimum changes needed
- Batch updates for better performance
- Provide predictable rendering

### 3. Declarative Programming
Instead of telling React HOW to update the UI, you tell it WHAT the UI should look like for any given state.

```jsx
// Declarative approach
function Counter({ count }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## React vs Other Frameworks

| Feature | React | Vue | Angular |
|---------|-------|-----|---------|
| Learning Curve | Moderate | Easy | Steep |
| Bundle Size | Small | Small | Large |
| Performance | High | High | High |
| Ecosystem | Vast | Growing | Complete |
| TypeScript | Optional | Optional | Built-in |

## Setting Up Development Environment

### Option 1: Create React App (Recommended for beginners)
```bash
npx create-react-app my-first-app
cd my-first-app
npm start
```

### Option 2: Vite (Faster alternative)
```bash
npm create react-app my-app -- --template react
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure
```
my-first-app/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── index.css
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Your First React Component

```jsx
// src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>
        <p>This is your first React application.</p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## React Developer Tools

Install the React Developer Tools browser extension to:
- Inspect component hierarchy
- View props and state
- Profile performance
- Debug hooks

## Common Misconceptions

1. **React is a framework** - React is a library focused on UI rendering
2. **JSX is required** - JSX is optional but highly recommended
3. **React is only for SPAs** - React can be used for any UI, including mobile apps
4. **Virtual DOM is always faster** - It's optimized for typical use cases, not always faster

## Exercise: Environment Setup

1. Install Node.js (version 16 or higher)
2. Create a new React app using Create React App
3. Install React Developer Tools in your browser
4. Modify the default App component to display your name
5. Start the development server and view your app

## Key Takeaways

- React is a library for building UIs with components
- Virtual DOM enables efficient updates
- Declarative programming makes code more predictable
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Great developer experience with modern tooling
